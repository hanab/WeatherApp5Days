## Technologies

## Networking and data parsing
For networking URLSession class was used , and no third party library is used for networking or json parsing

### XCTest

XCTest class was used to write small unit tests for some of the functions in the project.

## Things to improve

 * Currently the app shows the weather for Munich(which is hard coded), it could be extended to show to any selected city by just adding a picker
 * A spinner could be added to make the UI look better when the response is slow
